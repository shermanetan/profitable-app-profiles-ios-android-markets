## Project Overview

This project aims to analyse mobile app data from the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store** to identify characteristics of profitable apps. The objective is to help app developers make data-driven decisions about app categories, pricing models, and rating trends.

## Data Sources

**`AppleStore.csv`** (Apple App Store data):

• Includes app names, user ratings, genres, price, and other metadata.

• Contains over 7,000 iOS apps.

**`googleplaystore.csv`** (Google Play Store data):

• Includes app names, installs, ratings, size, and pricing information.

• Covers a diverse range of Android apps.

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

• Remove duplicate entries and handle missing values.

• Standardise data formats (e.g., numerical conversions, text cleaning).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Identify top-performing app categories based on ratings and downloads.

• Compare free vs paid apps in terms of popularity and user feedback.

• Analyse the correlation between price and rating.

### 3. Findings & Recommendations

• Determine which app categories are most profitable.

• Provide insights into pricing strategies for app developers.

## Results

• **Free apps** tend to have significantly higher download counts but may rely on ad revenue.

• **Paid apps** often receive higher average ratings, suggesting that users expect more quality.

• **Games and entertainment apps** dominate in terms of popularity but face high competition.

• **Educational and productivity apps** show strong profitability potential with less competition.

## Techniques Used

• **Python** (Pandas for data manipulation and analysis)

• **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)

• **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualisation)

## Conclusion

This project provides key insights into mobile app profitability, guiding developers on which categories to focus on and how pricing affects success. The findings can help shape business strategies in the competitive app marketplace.
